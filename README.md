# Genshin Impact Character Popularity Survey & Analysis

Python notebooks and results from a multi-year character popularity survey project for the game [*Genshin Impact*](https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/). Since 2021, I have conducted annual surveys within a private Discord community (typically 10–20 participants), collecting data on favorite characters, character rankings, and player preferences.

This repository covers the analysis since 2023; please refer to [this older repository](https://github.com/fireteamtorch/genshin_analysis) for the 2021-2022 results.

Data can be made available upon request.

## Selected Project Features

- **Survey Design & Collection:**  
  Annual survey data were collected via Google Forms and [TierMaker](https://tiermaker.com/create/genshin-impact-characters-13-792389) and aggregated in Google Sheets, then imported, cleaned and analyzed in Python (Google CoLab).

- **Aggregate Character Ranks & Tiers:**  
  Full-group character rankings relative to others and as separated into discrete "letter grade" tiers.

- **Longitudinal Trend Analysis:**  
  Tracking character popularity year over year to observe shifts, new character introductions, and evolving player sentiment.

- **Attribute Effects:**  
  Comparing character popularity with features such as vision, weapon type, region, rarity, and body type.

- **User-Level Insights:**  
  Examining how individual user preferences compare to other users and change longitudinally over years.

- **Exploratory Machine Learning:**  
  Some simple clustering / feature decomposition models to examine deeper trends within character rankings.
