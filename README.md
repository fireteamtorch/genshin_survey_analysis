# genshin_survey_analysis
This repository is a collection of analysis scripts for yearly [Genshin Impact](https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/) character surveys that I conducted in a Discord server following completion of each Version of Genshin. Data were collected via [Google Forms](https://workspace.google.com/products/forms/) and [TierMaker](https://tiermaker.com/create/genshin-impact-characters-13-792389) and aggregated in Google Sheets, then imported, cleaned and analyzed in Python (Google CoLab).

For the older surveys from 2021 and 2022 done in R, refer to [this repository](https://github.com/fireteamtorch/genshin_analysis/tree/main).
